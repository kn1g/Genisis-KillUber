 # Smart contract codes

Currently we have to smart contracts. One holds information to find the closest peers. IT acts as a bootstrap node for our peer-to-peer network between the app clients. The contract is called `booty`.

The other contract holds the persistent storage information. Specifically, driver, user and ride details. This contract is called `Persitore` (for persistent storage).
