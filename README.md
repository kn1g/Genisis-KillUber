# Genisis-KillUber

This project is a decentralized version of Uber. For persistent storage, the data is stored on a blockchain (for now this will be EOS). All time critical communication is handled by the app. The app is basically a node/client in a peer-to-peer network. The communication with the blockchain is handled via a light node.

## Repo structure
